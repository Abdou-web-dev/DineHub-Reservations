# Todo1: add a map above the customer's order, so that when a user chooses a location from the select dropdown,he will see a red circle placed above this location

<!-- @AbdelmounimSIFELHAK All the customer data is in the Redux store, you can use the useSelector to select the customer state, and if you need to access a specific customer's data you can write a selector function that takes a customer id value and searches the customers array. There shouldn't be much to need to pass around in props. â€“ -->
